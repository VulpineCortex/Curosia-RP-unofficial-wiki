OP
 Vulpine Cortex: What's the coldest region in the list of rp channels? is it ⁠frostovíyan-forest ?
[01:38]Mongo: Yes, it is the ⁠frostovíyan-forest
[01:38] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: what would you say is the average temperature there?
[01:40] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: For example, southern Siberia:
"The annual average temperature is about 0.5 °C (32.9 °F). January averages about −20 °C (−4 °F) and July about +19 °C (66 °F)"
subarctic Siberia:
"−5 °C (23 °F) and an average for January of −25 °C (−13 °F) and an average for July of +17 °C (63 °F)" 
[01:42]Mongo: I usually leave that stuff up to the users interpretation
[01:43]Mongo: Though I would say it’s similar climate to Canadian forest
[01:45] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: That's still rather broad but thx, at least I can make educated guesses down the line.

[01:55] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: is what way does the solar system deviate from ours?
It's quite common to keep things like atmosphere, gravity, weather patterns, day and year length the same. Is this the case here?
Is there 1 moon?; Can full eclipses happen?
are there any other planets?
Is the star the same mass as our own?
[01:58]Mongo: It’s pretty much the same as the solar system, but with more magic. The star is about the size the sun would have been 600 years ago

[01:49] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: What's the default technological level of the world? 
Kingdoms and Castles imply a medieval level of development.
Is there magic and does it affect the development of conventional science?
[01:55]Mongo: They have phones and modern appliances, but they use magic to travel places that they can’t walk to. As for kingdoms, the world is probably in the 1400’s era but is far more technologically advanced than it should be. Yes the magic does effect development, but they use it in place of technology.
[01:57] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so there's teleportation magic? 
[01:58]Mongo: Yes, but there’s also portal magic for if you can’t teleport/if teleporting takes too much of a toll on your body
[01:59]Mongo: The portals are more dimensional travel while teleporting is spacial warping
[02:01] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I know how I'm throwing my character into this world :3, one day a facility just manifests near one of the poles. 
[02:01]Mongo: That works well enough
[02:02] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex:
[02:03]Mongo: Considering there’s already been multiple characters that appeared in the world due to dimensional rifts, it would work just fine if you suddenly appeared one day
[02:07] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I have to wonder if people just got used to walking through the field, the look to the left at the trees, the look to the right, at the flowers, they look to the left again and suddenly there's a whole city block where the forest once was.

Hey Watson cinder block

[02:09]Mongo: Lol, probably. Shops come by quickly when you can just ask the goddess of creation and destruction to clear out an area for you and make you a shop
[02:09]Mongo: (Yes it is one goddess that has both powers)
[02:10] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: a factorio player will join and a whole-ass mega factory will spawn 
[02:13]Mongo: Free jobs for the civilians
[02:14] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: not even, as everything's automated
[02:14] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: and civilans get gunned down by the security perimeter
[02:15] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex:
[02:16]Mongo: Yeah, no. There’s not supposed to be extreme tech based factory, it wouldn’t really fit with the vibes

[21:45] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: Is there any map, however broad? It would be great for referencing geography during journeys, even if the details would have to be worldbuilt on the spot.
[21:46]Mongo: I don’t have a full map yet, but the map of Starazia is what I’m using as the server icon
[21:47] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so does Frostovía have any preexisting geography & lore?
[21:53] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I was thinking of creating an intro to my character in this world but I've realised that a (at the very least) 10 metre wide vechicle moving through a forest would mean leaving a trail of felled trees, I'd like to avoid that. In my setting there's no plants for miles so it's not a real issue the start.
[21:53]Mongo: As I’ve said to previous questions, Frostovíya is basically like a slightly altered Canada, so just look to their geography map until I can make one
[21:54]Mongo: Also, please try to keep travel to walking, flying, or magic
[21:54] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: no boats as well?
[21:55]Mongo: Boats can exist
[21:55]Mongo: Though they can’t be feuled by gasoline 
[22:03] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: also can't really do that since the character can't survive for long periods without electricity, they have a mobile fusion reactor for that purpose. They can travel only ~100(?) kilometers using stored hydrogen. I can worldbuild around that technological restriction but I'll most likely just come up with a funky biological abomination instead.
[22:04] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: can't really start with using handwavium 'till the character discovers magic in this world
[22:05] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I'm about to recreate Scorn :3
[22:08]Mongo: I understand that there are some things that are required for your character, but the world is supposed to be in a 1400’s time period that has more magic, and some tech (but coming in on something like a ferrari would not fit too well)
[22:08]Mongo: Protogens are allowed though
[22:17] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: protogens have the magic visor that breaks down all organic matter and somehow generates electricity for mechanical components, so not really something I'd like to use. The character's defined by their extensive knowledge in the year ~2400 and a body explicitly making use of that, they'd die instantly without the tech as the brain is in a seperate shell, connected via neurological components. I can bypass that using speculative biology or my own flavor of magic (nanomachines). Though without the technology a scholar character has to be explicitly uneducated by today's standard which clashes with the entire idea. They might just not be a great fit for this world.
[22:19]Mongo: I’m not saying all tech is banned, it’s just that you probably couldn’t use vehicles since it’s the 1400’s
[22:21] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: but 1400's mean no electricity.
[22:21]Mongo: It’s more advanced than the Earth’s 1400’s
[22:22]Mongo: They have phones, but oil has been banned by the gods of the world
[22:24] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so EVs are alright?
[22:24]Mongo: What’s an EV?
[22:24] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: Electric Vechicle
[22:24]Mongo: There’s no roads
[22:25] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I get that, that was my orginal concern, but boats don't need road now, do they?
[22:26] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: If I were to transplant the tech into a ship hull, the issue would be resolved.
[22:26] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: at least mostly resolved
[22:26]Mongo: As long as you can navigate around the ocean dwellers and the whirlpools, then yes
[22:27] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: alright, we're not doing Scorn, it's Barotrauma instead.
[22:28] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: most likely should be one of the main introductions of the world
[22:28]Mongo: Do all of your characters travel by/live on vehicles?
[22:32] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I mean no? This is somewhat of an exception. They do need infrastructure, they're basically a human based AI. Baseline humans don't need it, anything biological doesn't need it, most mechanical beasts just charge via a cloud of nanomachines. They are basically the only ones that are bound by the technology to that extent, at least until they learn to utilize magic. Then they get to use it as a power source instead.
[22:33]Mongo: Alright
[22:35] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: also if I were ever to construct a city as per character's goal, it would most likely have the infrastructure, both in terms of available charging stations and public transport, so the concerns are somwhat founded. What do you think about trains in the world?
[22:35]Mongo: No, they release too much natural gases
[22:36]Mongo: I’m trying to keep the world as eco-friendly as possible
[22:37] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: in the civilised world we have a thing called electrification.
[22:37]Mongo: Also, a character probably won’t be able to just build up a city
[22:39] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I get why that'd be a concerning thing from a (wait, it's can't be a DM... ) World Master perspective but why so?
[22:40] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: from a practical standpoint if you have a robotic workforce and/or magic, creating a city is not exactly impossible
[22:41]Mongo: I just don’t want people adding in civilization’s whenever they feel like it. It takes the server out of control of the staff team and breaks away from the connection the world currently has
[22:43] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so not impossible but inadvisable due to not being healthy for roleplay? I get that.
[22:43]Mongo: And I definitely don’t want factories or big projects that will require others to tear up a huge chunk of the ecosystem
[22:43] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: solarpunk?
[22:44]Mongo: There will usually be portal rooms at central locations that the people can use to travel around
[22:46] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: that's such a boring handwavium solution, but fine :hunterrip:
[22:47]Mongo: It’s more interesting than a character sitting on a train for like 5 hours just to get to a different city
[22:47]Mongo: And it keeps the flow of an rp going
[22:51] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: Depends, though for rp it's most likely more convenient.
Travel doesn't have to be boring, though I get that it's hard to make  it interesting.
[22:55] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so how would any petrochem products be handled? My world doesn't have any oil so there is no issue with designing systems that avoid it as an input, but if I were to synthesise methane, how would it be treated?
[22:56]Mongo: As long as it’s not something that releases harmful gases into the atmosphere, then it’s fine
[22:56]Mongo: Maybe idk
[22:57]Mongo: @Nightmare H. A. would probably know more about this stuff than me tbh
[23:00] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: That's fine by me.
[23:05] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: oh also you should probably specify the oil ban as one of the most important world tenants, the impact on the technological development would be a significant one, modern-day characters would have problems adapting.
[23:05] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: even if you replace most of it with magic, it'll still lead to a culture shock
[23:08]Mongo: I mean, the gods are very easy to contact if your character has a problem
[23:10] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: "I pray to yee, god, for I desire a metre wide cube of plastic" :3 
[23:11]Mongo: And the goddess of creation will probably give that to you, then she’ll tease you about how cringey that prayer was
[23:12] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: by design :CatHeart~1:
[23:12]Mongo: The goddess are very caring about everyone, but they are willing to tease people from time to time
[23:15] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: how about a nuke?
[23:16]Mongo: The gods will come down and kill you if you try to make a nuke
[23:16] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: how hard is it to kill a god?
[23:16]Mongo: They are impervious to all damage
[23:17] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: what about viscious mockery?
[23:17]Mongo: Then civilization will come after you
[23:18] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: ah, that's nothing that a mountain bunker and killbox can't handle :p
[23:20]Mongo: Yeah, I’m not allowing a thing called a killbox
[23:25] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: it's just an iteration upon the classic tactic / concept 
Kill zone
In military tactics, the kill zone, also known as killing zone, is an area entirely covered by direct and effective fire, an element of ambush within which an approaching enemy force is trapped and destroyed. The objective of the ambush force is to quickly kill or capture all enemy soldiers inside the kill zone. The trapped soldiers may respond ...
Kill zone

 Vulpine Cortex: wrong link lol
[23:25] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: now it's the right one
[23:25] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: though that one did weirdly fit as well 
[23:27]Mongo: I’m not even gonna begin to state why that isn’t allowed
[23:28] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: figured as much lol
[23:28] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: wdym by ocean dwellers? 
[23:29]Mongo: The fish are people too
[23:29] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: are there any non-sapient animals?
[23:29] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: or is everyone vegan
[23:30]Mongo: No to both
[23:30] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so predator species murder other people to live?
[23:30] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: grim 
[23:31]Mongo: You gotta survive somehow
[23:32] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: why don't they just ask the goddess of creation for the meat?
[23:33]Mongo: That’s the job of the goddess of nature, but she’s not as easy to summon
[23:33] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so do I have to worry about shark ppl trying to board my ship?
[23:34]Mongo: They might attack it if it gets too close
[23:35] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: how do I know if I'm close to their territory or not, are there any markings?
[23:35]Mongo: Nope, you just have to hope they aren’t nearby

@Vulpine Cortex - jump
alright, so the same way that nitrogen is turned into liquid would be used to turn methane into liquid methane, at room temp, it's stable like a gasoline, it would be kept under pressure in containers and slowly released into proper fire usage or chemically combined to be a form of mana fuel, which can be used to power high level magic, formed through fluid ducts into magical arrays, the mana type can change depending on a lot of things, using water charged liquid methane would cause the power of a fire spell to plummet and vice versa. it is difficult to make a neutral mana, so it is considered very expensive and changes upon user.
[23:38] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I'm worried for them, the armaments are balanced against anything lighter than an MBT, not against light infantry.
[23:38]Mongo: Infantry as in firearms?
[23:39] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex:
Image
[23:39]Mongo: What about armaments?
[23:40] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: armaments means guns, yes. The list is in the doc linked in a github
[23:40]Mongo: No guns
[23:40] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I can do railguns instead if smokeless powder is an issue 
[23:41]Mongo: Guns take away the point of the world being magical
[23:42] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: urban fantasy IS a genre, ya know?
[23:43] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so what is allowed in terms of weapons?
[23:43]Mongo: This is supposed to be medival fantasy with some technology 
[23:44]Mongo: You can have melee weapons or magic
[23:45] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: but protogens exist :3
The setting is inconsistent enough in order to have to ask about every single thing. This is especially problematic in my case since the character was designed for a mostly hard sci-fi setting, meaning everything relies on a thousand more years of technology in order to be possible.
[23:46]

 Vulpine Cortex: I can do melee, will just have to redesign.
[23:46]Mongo: Then use a character that fits the medieval fantasy vibes

 Vulpine Cortex: fair
[23:50]Mongo: A character can be mostly machine, but if they can adapt to the lands, they are allowed
[23:51]Nightmare H. A.: mostly, no, he is completely machine
[23:51]Mongo: That’s still allowed too
[23:51] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: there's A LOT of issues with that
[23:52] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: as seen by my example
[23:52]Mongo: There’s magic based electricity
[23:52]Nightmare H. A.: and the required quantum fuelcells? and the means to recharge them?
[23:53] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: that's what you get for the inclusivity :p
[23:53]Nightmare H. A.: M=>E conversion isnt enough
[23:53]Mongo: Just ask a goddess to make an infinite battery of whatever they need that they can use forever 
[23:53]Nightmare H. A.: they dont work for a reason
[23:54]Mongo: I’m guessing your main is nightmare
[23:54]Nightmare H. A.: mhm

OP
 Vulpine Cortex: technology is too hard, let's make a perpetual motion machine, it won't break anything!
[23:55] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: oh we didn't even talk about the time travel that the portals will cause
[23:55] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: unless they have a delay
[23:55]Nightmare H. A.: eternal energy without a cost breaks the truth of reality
[23:55]Mongo: There’s a reason why the alternate dimensions rp category exists
[23:56] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: should we just make our own server and make it a ⁠partnered-servers for a sci-fi setting?
[23:56] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: idk
[23:57]Mongo: I literally just said that there’s alternate dimensions
[23:57]Mongo: If you genuinely just have a problem entering the main world, I will make a channel for a sci-fi rp
[00:00] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: I mean I can modify the sona to a medieval setting, it'll lead to a lot more questions but it's doable
But if I were to just keep the sci-fi elements, there's no point keeping the fantasy worldbuilding, it'll cause constant inconsistencies
[00:00] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: so a new server would be warranted at that point
[00:01]Nightmare H. A.: see, that's why i call my 'portals' 'warpgates' because they break a hole into what is known as warpspace, and the force of it opening causes nearby things to be pulled in, there is a safety feature built in to make sure people aren't trapped into warpspace, both gates have to link, and agree, and set a specific time to break open, the force throwing them into and out of wearpspace in a way that they overlap, almost, will allow for a near instantaneous transfer of matter, breaking open and closing so fast, the natural eye cant perceive it
[00:03] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: but does that prevent time travel? you'd still have to limit the speed to that of the light, which granted, wouldn't cause a huge delay on a planetary scale
[00:03]Nightmare H. A.: there are an infinite number of layers of warpspace that all gates can be open at once and it wont even get 0.001%of it
[00:04]Mongo: It would literally be like walking through a door. So think of how much time it would take to to go through your bedroom door
[00:06] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: less, but issues arise once you start traveling to other planets; for mars it would be up to 20 minutes afaik 
[00:07]Nightmare H. A.: warpspace is a thing outside the constraints of time, thus the reason for two realspace gates to link and form a connection, that connection makes a channel through warpspace at two diffrent locations, so the matter doesnt intertwine with any other things traveling at the same existance
[00:07]Mongo: Idk why you would travel to Mars considering you can’t breathe there
[00:09] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: well, my character can manage without oxygen for some time, and with water and a fusion reactor you have A LOT of oxygen
[00:09] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: can also recycle it
[00:09]Nightmare H. A.: now that isnt what is used for getting on the ships
[00:09] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: wdym?
[00:09]Nightmare H. A.: that is known as the IMT devices
[00:10]Mongo: I don’t think you can have a fusion reactor
[00:10] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex:
[00:10]Nightmare H. A.: the Kontingency is a interuniversal starfleet
[00:11]Mongo: It falls into the category of mortals messing with the atom, which will never be allowed
[00:12] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: is the sun banned too?
[00:12]Mongo: No
[00:12]Mongo: You just can’t try to convert atoms because we don’t want people creating nukes
[00:14] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: you know that you don't need even need to artificially perform fission in order to make a nuke, right?
[00:15] 
OP
 Vulpine Cortex: you can just separate isotopes that exist naturally
